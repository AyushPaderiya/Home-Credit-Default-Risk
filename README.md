## 🔍 Project Overview

### 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation (Python)
- Loaded and merged multiple raw datasets relevant to loan applications and client profiles.
- Addressed missing values and filtered anomalies for quality assurance.
- Used `pandas` and `numpy` for efficient tabular operations and transformations.

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized important patterns using `matplotlib.pyplot`:
  - Loan amount distributions
  - Employment duration vs. creditworthiness
  - Anomalous and flagged data behavior
- Identified trends to support risk evaluation and segmentation.

### 📈 Interactive Dashboard (Power BI)
- Built a comprehensive Power BI report (`Report.pbix`) to visualize:
  - Loan application trends
  - Gender, state, and transaction category breakdowns
  - Flags for odd hour transactions, rapid frequency, and risk indicators
- Slicers and filters enable dynamic exploration based on demographics or business logic.
